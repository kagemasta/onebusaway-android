# SeattleBusBot / OneBusAway for Android

SeattleBusBot is the official native Android application for OneBusAway.

SeattleBusBot was the old name of the app -- it's now called "OneBusAway for Android" or, when speaking about the app itself, just "OneBusAway". It's listed in the Android Market as OneBusAway.

OneBusAway for Android provides:

1. Real-time bus arrival information for public transit
2. A browse-able map of nearby stops
3. The ability to search for nearby stops or routes

OneBusAway for Android automatically keeps track of your most used stops and routes, and allows you to put shortcuts on your phone's Main Menu for any stop or route you choose.

It's available on the Android Market: http://market.android.com/details?id=com.joulespersecond.seattlebusbot

The issues are still being tracked at Google Code: http://code.google.com/p/seattle-bus-bot/

## Build Setup

OneBusAway requires ActionBarSherlock: http://actionbarsherlock.com/

Luckily, the version that we use is already included for you in this repository. You just need to
import the SeattleBusBot/ActionBarSherlock project as an existing project. If you have trouble 
building, make sure you have the latest version of the Android SDK, Android ADT. It never hurts to
restart Eclipse and clean the project. If you still have trouble building, 
let me know at paulcwatts@gmail.com.
